/*!
 * @mainpage
 * <b>Description</b><br>
 * APRDL (code name SNB_Heaven) is an application to control an intelligent
 * nest box (SNB = Smart Nest Box).  It consists of the following components:
 *
 * <b>Microcontroller</b><br>
 * The heart of the board is an EFM32G230 microcontroller.  It provides two
 * different clock domains: All low-energy peripheral is clocked via a
 * 32.768kHz external XTAL.  The MCU and other high performance peripheral
 * uses a high-frequency clock.  The board can be configured to use the
 * internal RC-oscillator, or an external 32MHz XTAL for that purpose,
 * see define @ref USE_EXT_32MHZ_CLOCK.
 *
 * <b>DCF77 Atomic Clock</b><br>
 * When powered on, the DCF77 hardware module is enabled to receive the time
 * information and set the system clock.  During this phase, the Power-On LED
 * (i.e. LED1) shows the current state of the DCF signal.  The further behavior
 * depends on the settings in the <i>config.h</i> file.  If the define @ref
 * DCF77_ONCE_PER_DAY is 1, the receiver (and also the LED) will be switched
 * off after time has been synchronized.  As the name of the define suggests,
 * it will be switched on once per day.  To properly detect a change between
 * winter and summer time, i.e. <i>normal time</i> (MEZ) and <i>daylight saving
 * time</i> (MESZ), this happens at 01:55 for MEZ, and 02:55 for MESZ.<br>
 * If the define is 0, the receiver remains switched on, but the LED will only
 * get active again when the time signal gets out-of-sync.<br>
 *
 * <b>Light Barriers</b><br>
 * There is an inner and outer light barrier mounted on the front of the nest
 * box.  When activity is detected by one of the light barriers, the RFID
 * reader will be enabled.  The current state of the light barriers can be
 * viewed on the LC-Display by asserting the S1 button.
 *
 * <b>RFID Reader</b><br>
 * The RFID reader is used to receive the transponder number of the bird,
 * moving in or out of the nest box.  It is enabled by the light barriers
 * and shut down after @ref RFID_POWER_OFF_TIMEOUT seconds when there is no
 * more activity detected.
 *
 * <b>Keys (Push Buttons)</b><br>
 * There exist 3 push buttons on the board.  When asserted, the following
 * action will be taken:
 * - S1 displays the status of the light barriers (LBO is the outer, LBI the
 *   inner light barrier), and the battery voltage and remaining capacity.
 * - S2 displays the current date and time and the previously detected
 *   transponder number.  If this button is asserted for more than 5 seconds,
 *   the transponder number on the LCD will be cleared.
 * - S3 is the RESET button.
 *
 * The duration how long the respective information is displayed before
 * switching the LCD off again, can be adjusted by the define @ref
 * LCD_POWER_OFF_TIMEOUT.
 *
 * <b>LC-Display</b><br>
 * The display provides 2 lines รก 16 characters.  It is connected to the
 * EFM32 microcontroller via a parallel bus interface.  To save power, the
 * whole display usually is switched off and only activated by asserting a
 * push button or exchanging the SD-Card.  However, after a power-up or reset,
 * the LCD remains powered on until the system clock is synchronized with
 * the DCF77 atomic clock signal.  This allows the user to read the firmware
 * version, the free space on the SD-Card, and the log filename.
 *
 * The visual contrast of the LCD can be adjusted via @ref l_Contrast.
 *
 * <b>LEDs</b><br>
 * There are two LEDs, one is red, the other one is green.
 * - The red LED is the Power-On LED.  It shows the current state of the
 *   DCF77 signal during receiving of the time information.  In normal
 *   condition the LED will be switched off.
 * - The green LED is the Log Flush LED.  It flashes whenever there are write
 *   accesses to SD-Card.
 *
 * <b>SD-Card</b><br>
 * The SD-Card is used to store logging information.  Only formatted cards
 * can be used, supported file systems are FAT12, FAT16, and FAT32.  The
 * filenames must follow the DOS schema 8+3, i.e. maximum 8 characters for
 * the basename, and 3 for the extension.  If the SD-Card contains a file
 * <b>BOX<i>nnnn</i>.TXT</b>, where <b><i>nnnn</i></b> can be any decimal
 * number, this will be used as the new log file.  In this way the filename
 * allows you to assign a specific box number to a dedicated unit.  If no
 * such file exists on the media, file "BOX0999.TXT" is created.
 * - Removing an SD-Card
 *   -# Generate a log message by triggering the light barriers, optionally
 *      with a reference transponder.
 *   -# Wait about 5 seconds (@ref LOG_SAMPLE_TIMEOUT) until the green LED
 *      starts flashing.  Log data is now written to the SD-Card.
 *   -# When the green LED stops flashing, you have a guaranteed duration
 *      of 15 seconds (@ref LOG_FLUSH_PAUSE) where no further data will be
 *      written to the SD-Card.
 *   -# Remove the SD-Card within this time.  The message "SD-Card removed"
 *      will be displayed on the LCD for 20 seconds.  All newly generated log
 *      messages will be stored in memory until another media is available.
 *
 * - Inserting an SD-Card
 *   -# Just insert the SD-Card into the slot.  The message "SD-Card inserted"
 *      will be displayed on the LCD.
 *   -# The file system on the SD-Card will be mounted and the free space of
 *      the media is reported.
 *   -# If a firmware update file (*.UPD) exists on the SD-Card, a reboot will
 *      be initiated to pass control to the booter.
 *   -# Otherwise the firmware looks for a "BOX<n>.TXT" file to use as new log
 *      file.
 *
 * <b>Battery Monitor</b><br>
 * The battery pack has its own controller.  It is connected to the EFM32
 * microcontroller via I2C-bus.  The battery monitor requests status
 * information from the battery pack and logs this on a regular basis, i.e.
 * every @ref BAT_MON_INTERVAL seconds.
 *
 * <b>Low-Energy UART</b><br>
 * The Low-Power UART (LEUART) provides a connection to a host computer (PC).
 * It can be used as monitoring and debugging interface.  All log messages,
 * written to the SD-Card, are sent through this interface also.  This behaviour
 * can be changed by defining @ref LOG_MONITOR_FUNCTION to @ref NONE.
 * The format of this UART is 9600 baud, 8 data bits, no parity.
 *
 * <b>Firmware</b><br>
 * The firmware consists of an initialization part and a main loop, also called
 * service execution loop.  The initialization part sets up all modules, enables
 * devices and interrupts.  The service execution loop handles all tasks that
 * must not be executed in interrupt context.
 *
 * After power-up or reset the following actions are performed:
 * -# Basic initialization of MCU and clocks
 * -# Low-Energy UART is set up
 * -# LEDs are switched on for test purposes (lamp test)
 * -# The logging facility is initialized and the firmware version is logged
 * -# Further hardware initialization (Keys, DCF77, RFID reader, Light
 *    Barriers, SD-Card interface, Interrupts, Alarm Clock)
 * -# The LC-Display is activated and the firmware version is shown
 * -# LEDs are switched off after 4 seconds
 * -# The Battery Monitor is initialized
 * -# The DCF77 Atomic Clock is enabled to receive the time signal
 *
 * The program then enters the Service Execution Loop which takes care of:
 * - Power management for the RFID reader
 * - Power management for the LC-Display
 * - SD-Card change detection and re-mounting of the filesystem
 * - Battery monitoring
 * - Writing the log buffer to the SD-Card
 * - Entering the right energy mode

 * Low-Power peripherals, e.g. the LEUART still work in EM1.
 *
 * Examples:
 *
   @code
   // Module RFID requires EM1, set bit in bit mask

   // Module RFID is no longer active, clear bit in bit mask

 * On the APRDL board it sets the red power LED to the current state of
