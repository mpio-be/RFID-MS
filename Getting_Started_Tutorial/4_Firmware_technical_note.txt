APRDL (code name SNB_Heaven) is an application to control an intelligent
nest box (SNB = Smart Nest Box).  It consists of the following components:

- ExtInt.c - External interrupt handler.
- Keys.c - Key interrupt handling and translation.
- AlarmClock.c - Alarm clock and timers facility.
- DCF77.c - DCF77 Atomic Clock Decoder
- clock.c - An implementation of the POSIX time() function.
- LCD_DOGM162.c - Driver for the DOGM162 LC-Display.
- Display.c - Display manager for LCD.
- LightBarrier.c - Interrupt logic for the outer and inner light barrier,
  enables the RFID reader.
- RFID.c - RFID reader to receive transponder IDs.
- BatteryMon.c - Battery monitor, periodically reads the state of the
  battery via the SMBus.
- LEUART.c - The Low-Energy UART can be used as monitoring and debugging
  connection to a host computer.
- microsd.c - Together with the files "diskio.c" and "ff.c", this module
  provides an implementation of a FAT file system on the SD-Card.
- Logging.c - Logging facility to send messages to the LEUART and store
  them into a file on the SD-Card.
