# RFID Management System RFID-MS
APRDL alias SNB_Heaven

Platform for Animal Observation 

An efficient system to monitor animal behaviour in the wild
as well as under laboratory settings

-	Compatible with different RFID systems and triggers
-	Low power consumption and specific data collection lead to long lasting collection periods
-	Applicable world-wide due to its compatibility with different types of radio clock receivers 
-	High observation quality through low disturbance of the animals

- Time Synchronization to atomic clock once a day to ensure optimal data quality
- Current Control twice a day
- Forecast for Battery-Change implemented
- Energy Bypass so that Date and Time are maintained even when changing battery
- Hyperterminal Output to get real-time data in the field.
- Low-Power Device: 
    sleep: 12V@40µA
    awake: 12V@12mA
